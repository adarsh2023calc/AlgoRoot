# AlgoRoot

AlgoRoot is a Python-based API service that dynamically retrieves and executes automation
functions using LLM + RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). The system should process
user prompts, map them to predefined automation functions, and generate executable Python
code for function. 

## Features
-Application Control: Open Chrome
System Monitoring: Retrieve CPU/RAM usage etc


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
